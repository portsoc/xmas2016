# Christmas Lecture 2016

Every year we keep schedule a little slack around Christmas so that if there are any unforseen circumstances in the term we have a week spare in which to re-schedule key work.

In today's lecture, we opened an blank editor and a browser side by side, and opened the floor to requests for what to add.  We coded for the full 50 minutes that were available and last request (snow) came in as everyone was leaving, so we pulled the snow code from last year's festive page.

The content herein is *far* from perfect - it's presented here in its unfinished form for reference.  We could go back and improve and simplify much of what we have made, but like all code, it evolved as we wrote it, and the realizations and lessons we learned as we coded we shared with the lecture theater where there just wasn't time to redo everything.

You are, of course, welcome to tidy things up.
